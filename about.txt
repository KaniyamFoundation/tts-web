Frequenly Asked Questions

What types of files can be uploaded?
Only Tamil Unicode text files are supported. File can be upto 100 MB.

Why do I have to register? Can I upload files without registering?
The TTS conversion is slow process. It may take few hours to complete. Waiting with browser tab open for few hours is not possible. To notify the user, after the file conversion, sending email is one simple way. Thats why we ask for registering.
Tell us if there are even better ways.

Shall I upload my private files?
If you have more private, secret files, dont upload here. Dont upload to any of the online applications.
Anyhow, this is Free/Open Source Software. you can install this in your home ubuntu/linux computer. 

You can upload here general files, which are not too private to you. We have made essential settings so that you only can access your files. No other can access your files. (Except admins and server providers).

How long the MP3 files will be there on the server?
For now, we keep them for 3 days as testing. After three days, they will be deleted automatically.

Why there is only male voice? Why cant we have female voice?
Female voice is in testing. Will add soon.

Why there is only Tamil TTS? We need for other languages too.
Other languages TTS are in our action items. We are yet to find suitable TTS and how to use them. If you know about them, let us know.

Is this software a safer one?
Not 100%. As this is Free/Open source software, you can check its code at https://github.com/KaniyamFoundation/tts-web There are many security related things to do like adding SSL. Encrypting the files and hard disks etc. We will do them soon.

How to install this on Windows?
No. Not possible.

Why?
When you have only two wheeler vehicle, we hope, you wont try to fit a car seat on it and ride.
